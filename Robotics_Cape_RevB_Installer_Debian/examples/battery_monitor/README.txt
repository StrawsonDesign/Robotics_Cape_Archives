Battery Monitor for Robotics Cape
James Strawson - 2013

Project Description:
Battery Monitor Service for Robotics Cape or General BeagleBone use. This program illuminates a set of 4 LEDS on the Robotics Cape to indicate battery charge level of a 2S, 3S, or 4S Lithium Ion or Polymer Battery. Also shuts down BeagleBone when voltage dips too low to protect the battery from over-discharging.
